### 1. Definition of ideology (Marx)
   1. Reproduction of labor & relations
      1. Reproductive labor
      2. Labor force learns know-how, and they are all destined for a specific role, they learn to respect discipline and the division of labor. They learn the “rules”
      3. They must not only reproduce labor, they must reproduce submission to “the rules” through false consciousness.
   2. Infrastructure/Superstructure
      1. Infrastructure—economic base: produces unity of productive forces and relations of production
      2. Superstructure—two levels: law and state; ideology (different ideologies, religious, ethical, legal, political, etc.)
   3. Determinism
      1. Base determines superstructure.
      2. Ideology is a projection of the consciousness of the ruling class.
      3. Superstructure is either autonomous or reciprocal to the base.
      4. Althusser says enacting the belief creates the belief. “Kneel and pray and then you will believe”
